      "description": "Dr. Bickham was the coroner for the small town of Slaughter. For the past few decades, he had looked death in the face - that was what the job required, and he was good at it. Until January 3, 2022.  He was called out to the small white suburban house with the well manicured lawn - he could tell someone had died there judging by the smell. He walked into the living room and there in the center was a couch.  The living room was organized and tidy even, except this couch was at the center covered in feces. The smell was stinging his eyes. He walked closer, and he saw - melted, into the couch the body of a young woman.  She was unclothed, maggots in her hair, rotting flesh eaten off her bones, and she was sitting there with her eyes and mouth open. She had been sitting on this very couch, alive, for the past 12 years.   Full Source Notes: rottenmangopodcast.com",

She had just given birth in the car coming home from Walmart. A normal delivery is already dangerous but to give birth in a moving vehicle, while driving, could pose a lot of health risks. It was all hands on deck in the emergency room. If the mother’s uterus was bleeding heavily - that could mean life or death for the mother. The nurse put her fingers on her stomach (as a trained nurse she could tell by pressing on the outside of one’s stomach if blood was dangerously flowing from the uterus). But she felt nothing. No blood flow. No uterus. The nurse froze. She turned to her colleagues in pure horror and stated - that’s not her baby. Then whose baby could it be? And whose blood is this woman covered in?

Sure, they all ran in the same circles - knew all the same people, but was that really a reason to keep them in competition with one another? Each one felt like they were above the other 2. But Kanae hated Miyuki for a reason that ran a lot deeper than just competition. She hated that her love interest spent a lot of time with Miyuki. What did she have that Kanae didn’t? Kanae stated she had never felt jealousy in her entire life - till this moment. She couldn’t help but wonder… if her love interest was going to write a book on female serial killers - why couldn’t he just have wrote the book about her? Today’s case dives into the lives of Japan’s 3 most notorious female serial killers and their ongoing hatred for each other in prison.

Some believed she ran off with a guy she met online. Others speculated her ex-boyfriend had something to do with it. Or her best friend. Her best friend was the last one to see her alive. But they all agreed - wherever she was now… she was far away from the school. They couldn’t have been more wrong. Gao’s body was found in the locked boy’s restroom in the main building of the boarding school. Her body had signs of torture, SA, and even necrophilia.

Sure, they all ran in the same circles - knew all the same people, but was that really a reason to keep them in competition with one another? Each one felt like they were above the other 2. But Kanae hated Miyuki for a reason that ran a lot deeper than just competition. She hated that her love interest spent a lot of time with Miyuki. What did she have that Kanae didn’t? Kanae stated she had never felt jealousy in her entire life - till this moment. She couldn’t help but wonder… if her love interest was going to write a book on female serial killers - why couldn’t he just have wrote the book about her? Today’s case dives into the lives of Japan’s 3 most notorious female serial killers and their ongoing hatred for each other in prison.

She was known for her talent, but her signature was her big smile and fiery personality. And after 28 years in the industry, she wasn’t slowing down now. Her most recent project - she was a judge on The Voice Of China. June 2, 2023 - Coco Lee left a voice message for her fan group telling them how much she loves them, thanks them for their support, and misses them. She was always such a positive ray of sunshine to her fans. That very same day, Coco Lee would be dead. Soon after, a 9-minute audio clip was released revealing to the world that Coco Lee had endured bullying, humiliation, and abuse while on set for The Voice Of China. This is the case of how one of the most famous shows in China played an “evil” role in the death of an icon.  Full Source Notes: rottenmangopodcast.com",

      "description": "Nobody was seen entering or exiting the couple’s hotel room, but now they were both dead. The girlfriend was found in the bathtub strangled to death by her own pajamas. It was clear she had been murdered. Her boyfriend was found naked, crawling down the hallway groaning for help. He had 20 wounds all over his body including on his back - they were inflicted using a sharp, jagged edge of a broken beer bottle. Authorities stated the boyfriend murdered his girlfriend in a crime of passion before taking his own life. But nothing was adding up… How did he inflict all those wounds on his back? Why would he suddenly turn on his girlfriend? Why did they have multiple different hotel reservations that same night in Bali?

When she walked inside her apartment building and waited for her elevator- the stalker came up behind her and kicked her in the head 6 times. She was knocked unconscious… he then dragged her limp body to a dark corner of the lobby that didn’t have CCTV cameras. He was with her body for 7 minutes. What on earth happened in those 7 minutes?

Hospital staff rushed to clean up the biohazard only to stumble upon Alexee’s haunting secret concealed within the bathroom trash can. She had been 9 months pregnant. She had given birth in the bathroom. And now there was a dead baby at the bottom of the bin.   Full Source Notes: rottenmangopodcast.com",

      "description": "Jade had always been a good stepdaughter. Ever since she was 12, she had respected, loved, and admired her stepfather. Even now, at 37 years old, she was his primary caretaker. Her stepdad struggled with his health and every time he was hospitalized, Jade wanted to do something nice for him. She would clean his entire house so that he wouldn’t have to come home to a messy place. She didn’t have to, but she wanted to. One fateful day in December 2020, she was cleaning his office when his computer screen came alive. She looked up to see the desktop photo was a picture of a woman’s nude breasts. She stumbled backward. She was shocked. Not because it was a nude photo - but because it was her nude photo. She searched his computer and found hundreds and hundreds of meticulously organized nude photos of herself. Some dating as far back as when she was 16 years old. This discovery would lead her down a path of destruction that would end in murder.  Full Source Notes: rottenmangopodcast.com",
